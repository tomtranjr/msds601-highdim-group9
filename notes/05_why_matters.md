# 5: Why this actually matters in the real world

High-dimensional problems are everywhere:

- **Genomics & bioinformatics:** You've got more genes than patients.
- **Finance:** Tons of economic indicators, not so many time points.
- **Text & NLP:** Every word in the dictionary becomes a feature.
- **Image/video ML:** Each pixel wants to be a predictor. Our smartphone photo has millions of predictors but you might only have thousands of training images.

Without high-dimensional methods, traditional regression basically gets a panic attack and starts giving you nonsense answers.
