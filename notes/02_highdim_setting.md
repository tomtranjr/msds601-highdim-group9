# 2: The high-dimensional setting

Now imagine the number of predictors $p$ is **large relative to $n$**. This leads to two troublesome scenarios:  

1. **Wide data**: $p > n$.
   - Example: Gene expression: 20 patients, 10,000 genes.

2. **Comparable size**: $p \approx n$.  
   - Example: $n=100$, $p=80$. Not quite a disaster, but we definately start to get nervous.

This is what people mean by **high-dimensional regression**.
