# Regularization Toolbox

## Ridge Regression

Adds an $\ell_2$ penalty to stabilize coefficient estimates and control variance. Ridge keeps all predictors but shrinks them toward zero.

## LASSO

Adds an $\ell_1$ penalty that can set coefficients exactly to zero, performing variable selection and model compression.

## Elastic Net

Combines Ridge and LASSO penalties. This hybrid approach balances coefficient shrinkage with sparsity.
