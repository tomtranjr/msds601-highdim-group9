## 0: High-Dimensional Regression in one sentence

High-dimensional regression is what happens when you have too many variables trying to estimate too few data points ($p \geq n$), turning our nice, well-behaved OLS into a huge mess that then requires tools and techniques like Ridge, LASSO, or dimension reduction.

## 0.1: A couple more sentences about High-Dimensional Regression

High-dimensional regression is NOT a single method, rather an umbrella term for types of regression problems one may encounter during their linear regression journey, where:

$n \approx p$: the number of observations is about the same as the number of predictors.

$p \gg n$: the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations.
